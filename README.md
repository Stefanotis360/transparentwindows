Transparentwindows
==================

### Extension for adding windows transparency to gnome-shell.
* support for global transparency setting
* support for per window transparency setting

#### Tested on:
* 3.8.2 
* 3.9.2 

### How to use:
* select globar transparency from the menu to set transparency for all new / currently existing windows
* to set a custom transparency value to a window, select it then use the active window slider to set the required transparency.
* NOTE: windows with custom transparency will ignore global transparency settings
* to remove custom transparency value from a window, select it and click "clear active window transparency", it will reset it to the global transparency value.

### WARNING:
* This extension may break anything else that changes opacity.
* Having many transparent windows may and probably will kill your performance. You may expiriance lag while dragging windows around. It all depends on your hardware tho.
